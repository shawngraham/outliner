# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

1. **Open** `note-cards-canvas.html` in your web browser
2. **Click** the "Load Files" button at the top
3. **Select** your markdown files (.md) from your computer

That's it! Each file becomes one or more cards on the canvas.

## File Formats

The app supports **two formats** - use whichever works for you:

**Option 1:** One file = One card
```markdown
# Card Title
Card content here...
```

**Option 2:** One file = Multiple cards (use `#-------` separator)
```markdown
# First Card
Content...
#-------
# Second Card
More content...
```

The app automatically detects which format you're using!

## What You Can Do

### Organize Your Ideas
- **Drag cards** around to arrange them visually
- **Drag empty space** to pan around the canvas
- **Create connections** by dragging one card onto another

### Edit and Refine
- **Double-click a card** to edit its title and content
- **Click the card header** to expand/collapse it
- **Double-click a connection** to delete it
- **Double-click empty space** to create a new card

### Export Your Work
- **Click "Export to Markdown"** to download an organized outline
- The export follows your connection arrows to determine order
- Cards are formatted as `[Title]` with content below

## Your Work is Saved

Everything is automatically saved in your browser:
- The files you loaded
- Card positions and connections
- Any edits you made
- Canvas pan position

Close the browser and come back later - it will all be there!

## Example Workflow

1. **Load your research notes** (5-10 markdown files)
2. **Arrange them** on the canvas - group related ideas
3. **Draw connections** from introduction → main points → conclusion
4. **Edit cards** to refine the content
5. **Export to markdown** to get a linear outline
6. **Use the outline** as a starting point for your document

## Tips

- Start with the "topmost" card at the top of the canvas (this is your starting point for export)
- Use connections to show the logical flow of ideas
- You can reorganize anytime - just move cards and redraw connections
- Export multiple times to try different organizations
