# Chapter 2: Literature Review

A comprehensive literature review synthesizes existing research to identify gaps and establish theoretical frameworks for your study.

## Purpose and Goals
The literature review establishes context for your research, identifies gaps in existing knowledge, builds on previous work, and demonstrates scholarly understanding of your field.

## Search Strategies
Use academic databases (JSTOR, Google Scholar, PubMed) with relevant keywords. Employ Boolean operators and track your sources systematically using citation management tools.

## Critical Analysis
Don't just summarize sources—analyze their methodologies, compare findings, identify contradictions, and evaluate theoretical frameworks. Consider limitations and biases in the literature.

## Synthesizing Sources
Group sources by themes or methodologies. Show how different perspectives relate to each other and your research question. Identify patterns and trends in the field.

## Writing the Review
Organize your review chronologically, thematically, or methodologically. Maintain a critical voice while being fair to source authors. Use transitions to show relationships between ideas.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Watch out for lack of organization, pure summary without analysis, insufficient coverage of the field, and over-reliance on secondary sources. Ensure your voice guides the narrative.
