#Note 1: Rhetorical Précis of "As We May Think" Vannevar Bush, in "As We May Think", asserts that science should prioritize the massive task of making the bewildering store of human knowledge more accessible and commanding, rather than continuing primarily to extend man's physical powers. Bush supports this claim by detailing how specialization is causing investigators to become bogged down by an ever-growing mountain of research, highlighting that traditional methods for transmitting and reviewing scholarly work are now totally inadequate, and then proposing the Memex—a future device using advanced techniques like microphotography, dry photography, and eventually associative indexing—as an enlarged, intimate supplement to individual memory. The author’s purpose is to hold up an incentive for scientists to pursue the perfection of pacific instruments following wartime work, in order to mechanize the record more fully and prevent mankind from overtaxing its limited memory, allowing society to reacquire the privilege of forgetting things not immediately needed.
