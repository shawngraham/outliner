# Welcome to Note Cards

This outlining tool helps you organize your thoughts visually with connected cards.

## Getting Started
- Double-click to create new cards
- Drag cards to reposition them
- Connect related ideas by dragging one card onto another

## Key Features
The tool supports expandable cards for detailed content, visual connections between ideas, and persistent storage of your work in your browser.

## Tips for Success
Start with broad concepts, then add supporting details. Use connections to show relationships between ideas. Each markdown file becomes one card on the canvas.
