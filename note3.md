#Note 3: Rhetorical Précis of "A Prehistory of Social Media"
Kevin Driscoll, in "A Prehistory of Social Media" (Summer 2022
), argues that the popular, narrow histories of the internet—which focus overwhelmingly on the US government, military origins (like ARPANET), and Silicon Valley "geniuses"—fail to account for the crucial, grassroots development of early online communities. Driscoll supports this argument by exploring the parallel "modem world" that developed primarily in the 1980s, emphasizing how community-oriented amateurs and entrepreneurs utilized Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs), hosted on personal computers (PCs) and accessible via dial-up modems, to provide low-cost, idiosyncratic infrastructures for online social life. The author’s purpose is to recover the history of the modem world, which foreshadowed later intensely personal and interactive platforms, in order to provide a fuller history of the internet and offer insights that might help build healthier online communities that are more just, equitable, and inclusive.
