#Note 2: Research Memo on "As We May Think" (Bush)

INITIAL OBSERVATION: WHAT IF... the ultimate goal of information science isn't to create better libraries, but to create a better brain?
The really cool insight from Bush is that the difficulty we face isn't just that we publish too much, but that our methods of using the record are still stuck in the days of square-rigged ships. He argues that the way we organize information—alphabetically or numerically—is totally "artificial" because it forces you to find information by tracing it down from subclass to subclass, meaning an item can only be in one place unless duplicates are used. The brain doesn't work like that; it uses selection by association. The Memex is brilliant because it's designed specifically to mimic this fluid, associative mental process, allowing a user to build permanent, individualized "trails" through the "maze" of materials, connecting widely separated sources like binding them into a new book. It's essentially an "enlarged intimate supplement" to individual memory.

MY OBSERVATION: It's fascinating how Bush recognized that the biggest bottleneck in knowledge wasn't storage but retrieval, and that traditional systems (like libraries) were the problem, not the solution. The idea of the Memex reminds me that many of the tools we now take for granted (like hypertext, which Berners-Lee eventually picked up) were conceived as ways to literally replicate or enhance human cognition. This suggests that the early digital pioneers weren't just building machines, they were engaging in philosophical engineering, seeking "relief... from laborious detailed manipulation" to free the brain for "something more than repetitive detailed transformations". If the modern Web is struggling with its "bewildering store of knowledge", maybe it’s because we ended up adopting the decentralized nature of the Web (hypertext/trails) without fully committing to the individualized and private archival vision of the Memex.
