# Example: Outlining Strategies

Effective outlining helps organize complex information and create logical flow in your writing.

## Hierarchical Structure
Start with main ideas at the top level, then add supporting details beneath each main point. This creates a clear organizational framework.

## Flexibility
Good outlines are flexible—be willing to rearrange sections as your understanding develops. The note card approach makes this easy through visual reorganization.

## Connections Matter
Use connections between cards to show how ideas relate to each other. This reveals the logical structure of your argument.

## Iterative Process
Outlining is not a one-time activity. Revisit and refine your outline as you research and write. Let the structure evolve with your thinking.
