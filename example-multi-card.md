# Introduction to Research

Research is a systematic investigation designed to discover new knowledge or validate existing theories. It follows structured methodologies to ensure reliable and valid results.

Key principles:
- Objectivity
- Reproducibility
- Systematic approach
- Evidence-based conclusions

# Research Questions

A good research question is:
- Clear and focused
- Answerable through empirical investigation
- Significant and original
- Feasible within constraints

Examples:
- How does X affect Y?
- What is the relationship between A and B?
- Why does Z occur in context C?

# Literature Review

The literature review serves multiple purposes:
1. Establishes context for your research
2. Identifies gaps in existing knowledge
3. Demonstrates understanding of the field
4. Justifies your research approach

Critical analysis is essential - don't just summarize sources, evaluate their methodologies and contributions.

# Methodology

Choose methods appropriate to your research question:

**Qualitative**: Interviews, observations, case studies
**Quantitative**: Surveys, experiments, statistical analysis
**Mixed Methods**: Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches

Consider:
- Validity and reliability
- Ethical considerations
- Resource constraints
- Time requirements

# Data Analysis

Analysis transforms raw data into meaningful insights:

- Clean and organize your data
- Apply appropriate analytical techniques
- Look for patterns and relationships
- Test hypotheses if applicable
- Remain open to unexpected findings

Statistical software and qualitative analysis tools can aid this process.

# Conclusions

Strong conclusions:
- Answer your research questions
- Relate findings to existing literature
- Acknowledge limitations
- Suggest future research directions
- Consider practical implications

Avoid overgeneralizing or claiming more than your data supports.
